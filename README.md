A Haskell programmed maze puzzle game.<br>
A player starts from the top left corner of the maze, moves in the complex and branched passages to find the exit of the maze.<br>
## Modes
The game includes the following modes:<br>
(1) Randomly changing walls: after the player has moved 10 steps in the maze, a random wall in the maze will change and create new paths for the player to find.<br>
(2) Ghost: A ghost will start chasing the player after the player starts moving. The ghost can start from any place in the maze.<br>
